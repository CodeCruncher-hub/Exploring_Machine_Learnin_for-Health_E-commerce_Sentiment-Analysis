# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of projects focusing on machine learning techniques for classification tasks. The projects include:
Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Naive Bayes Text Classification using Amazon Product Reviews.
Sentiment Analysis on Google Play Store Apps Reviews.
Bayesian Neural Networks using built-in datasets.

# Breast Cancer Risk Prediction (KNN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used in this project to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is diagnosed as malignant (M) or benign (B). The dataset used includes various features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, symmetry_worst, and fractal_dimension_worst, among others.

# Naive Bayes Text Classification using Amazon Data
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes theorem with the naive assumption of feature independence. This project involves classifying Amazon product reviews as positive or negative.

# Sentiment Analysis on Google Play Store Apps Reviews
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on Google Play Store apps reviews to classify them as positive or negative.

# Bayesian Neural Network Practice
This project involves practicing with Bayesian Neural Networks using built-in datasets. Bayesian Neural Networks incorporate uncertainty in the model weights and provide probabilistic predictions.
